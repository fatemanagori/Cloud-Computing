<ins>**DESCRIPTION**</ins>

<ins>**To calculate Pi we use:**</ins>

[MapReduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2clwKnrtO8)




In this Project we find the value of Pi by generating random numbers, we also demonstrate manual solution to find the value of Pi using Map Reduce  method and implement the same program at Google Cloud Platform.





<ins>**ANALYSIS**</ins>

In this Project we successfully calculated the value of Pi with the random numbers generated. The value of Pi we got was 2.8 and the inside darts where 70 and outside 30 but we can get more accurate value of Pi by generating large numbers of random samples.




<ins>**INSTALLATION**</ins>

I use [Google Cloud Platform](https://prwatech.in/blog/hadoop/hadoop-cluster-on-google-cloud-platform-gcp/#:~:text=Hadoop%20Cluster%20on%20Google%20Cloud%20Platform%20%28GCP%29%201,be%20created%20as%20per%20your%20configuration%20More%20items) as a primary tools for MapReduce  
development. 
Basically, to reproduce enviroment, you need to create virtual machine at GCP with ubuntu 18 or above 

**Pre Requisite** [java-8 & Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html)
