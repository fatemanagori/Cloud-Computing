Collaborative filtering is a system that predicts user behavior based on historical user data. From this, we can understand that this is used as a recommendation system. For example, Amazon recommends products or gives discounts based on historical user data or YouTube recommends videos based on your history.

# Why do we need this though?
We want to encourage user engagement, by trying to predict what the user may enjoy or require so that we can get the user hooked to our service. We have designed unique algorithms for services like Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon so that we can give recommendations based on the user’s preference and remove redundant and irrelevant information.

There are three types of recommendation systems :

**1.Content-based filtering**: We use the user’s historical activity data(like what movies he likes, what movies he doesn’t like) to make predictions about similar products that the user is going to like.

**2.Collaborative filtering:** In this technique, we use the historical data of other preferences of other users (hence the word collaborative) to make predictions about what a particular user may like. Say, many users who have watched the movie Iron Man, have also watched Avengers. Hence, our system will recommend Avengers to the user who has only watched Iron Man.

**3.Hybrid model:** As the name suggests, this system is a combination of the above two models.
